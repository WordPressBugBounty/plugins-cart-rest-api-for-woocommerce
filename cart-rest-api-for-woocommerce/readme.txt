= Recommended Requirements =

* WordPress v6.3 or higher.
* WooCommerce v9.0 or higher.
* PHP v8.0 or higher.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Upgrading =

It is recommended that anytime you want to update CoCart that you get familiar with what's changed in the release.

CoCart publishes [release notes via the changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#developers).

CoCart uses Semver practices. The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes.
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can read more about the details of Semver at [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does CoCart do? =

CoCart provides a frontend API for WooCommerce, enabling headless eCommerce development. Instead of being locked into WordPress themes, you can build lightning-fast storefronts with modern frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, or any technology you prefer.

= Who should use CoCart? =

**Developers** who are tired of working on slow performance WooCommerce storefronts and want the freedom to build with modern frameworks. Perfect for:
- Frontend developers building headless eCommerce stores
- Agencies creating high-performance client sites
- Mobile app developers needing eCommerce APIs
- Anyone wanting infinite customization

= Are there any limitations? =

CoCart is designed with developers in mind allowing for complete control to customize or add support for a plugin to work with CoCart. CoCart does its best to work out of the box but if there is a compatibility issue with a plugin that you would like to work with CoCart. We would be happy to hear about it.

= What is the source of truth? =

CoCart sources the WooCommerce’s Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless eCommerce on another domain? =

Absolutely. That is what CoCart is mainly developed for. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can manually enable it via the filters available [in the documentation](https://cocartapi.com/docs/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Will CoCart interfere with other plugins? =

The majority of plugins are not REST API specific so it shouldn't. However, while we allow the source of truth for compatibility, there may be a WooCommerce extension that returns data via an action hook that the REST API cannot understand during a specific action and may fail the response.

If that does happen, simply report the situation with as much detail as possible on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues) and we will try our best to find a solution.

= How do I set up CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed and set up to your configurations. Then install CoCart, activate and you're ready to start using the REST API following the API Reference provided.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Why use CoCart if the WooCommerce API already exists? =

The WooCommerce REST API is primarily for store management (orders, products, coupons, etc.) and is designed for authenticated admins/apps. It isn’t built for customer cart flows.

CoCart fills this gap. It's specifically built for frontend cart handling where you want a seamless shopping experience that mimics traditional WooCommerce behavior but via API.

It’s optimized, extendable, and built for performance in decoupled setups.

= Why use CoCart and not WooCommerce’s Store API? =

To better answer this question in detail, please read [our comparison article](https://cocartapi.com/cocart-vs-woocommerces-store-api/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can we support SSO? =

CoCart itself doesn’t use cookie-based authentication — it supports Basic and JWT Authentication (via add-on), which are stateless and frontend-friendly. So when a user logs in through your headless site/app, they're authenticated for API requests — including cart operations.

= Can we call other WP APIs alongside CoCart? =

Definitely. CoCart doesn't block or replace any part of the WP or WC APIs — it works alongside them. Once authenticated, your headless site/app can access any available endpoint, whether from CoCart, WooCommerce, or custom APIs you've built.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

**Yes, CoCart is built for developers.** If you can make HTTP requests and work with JSON responses, you're ready to use CoCart.

**Skill level needed:**
- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Experience with JavaScript, React, Vue, or your preferred frontend framework
- Familiarity with HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)

**No WordPress development experience required!** CoCart abstracts away WordPress complexity, giving you clean, predictable API responses.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation [here](https://cocartapi.com/docs/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 200+ filters available to customize to your needs.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler and table in the database? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that may be required to help you**.
- The default session handler **does not allow support for POS capability**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

No. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any custom REST APIs from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. We don't recommend it. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes, you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues). You can also notify us via the [Discord community server](https://cocartapi.com/community/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) in the #bug-report channel – be sure to search the forum to confirm that the error has not already been reported.

= CoCart is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can!

> Developer note: This allows you to then alter values such as the billing country. See example.

`
add_filter( 'cocart_get_customer_billing_country', function( $value ) {
	if ( WC()->countries->country_exists( $value ) ) {
		return WC()->countries->get_countries()[ $value ];
	}

	return $value;
}, 10, 1);
`
